                <h5 class="card-title">Healing of a Blood Disorder</h5>
                <p class="card-text">9 yrs. ago, my husband was diagnosed with a rare blood disease. It was a fatal disease. In JAN. he went to the doctor and the condition got worse. He had to see the doctor more often and was kind of getting close to the final stage. We came here and prayed. Twice the Priest gave a message at different prayer sessions regarding a healing the Lord was granting to someone with a blood disease. On our 3rd visit, I prayed to Jesus to give a sign if this healing is for my husband. And the Priest gave the message again. My husband then went to the doctor and the tests were done in MAY. Contrary to the result in JAN., everything went down, the result got better with no treatment. Who could do that? Only GOD. Thank you Jesus.

This guy called us up the very next day(Sunday) and asked us to go over to his house and collect the money. And the check cleared in 2 days and we got the money.</p>

But 2 years ago she was diagnosed with lung cancer. I was very optimistic. I prayed & fasted. I shared the Gospel and did charity. But my mother passed away last year, and my heart & spirit was completely broken. I couldn't smile. I became angry at God. Felt meaningless & purposeless. I came here and after the Retreat, I can feel my heart is not as broken & empty as it was before. I feel lighter and praying for continuous healing.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Amazing Inner Healing</h5>
            <p class="card-text">My parents divorced when I was 2 months old. My dad rejected me when I was 8 years old and 16 years old when I met him on the road. I do not know whether he is dead or alive. I realized I blocked him out completely from my thoughts. For the first time, during this 3-day Retreat, I forgave him in the retreat and confessed my anger, bitterness, rejection and all the wounds. Thank you Jesus.</p>
